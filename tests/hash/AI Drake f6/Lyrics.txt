(Verse 1) 
This is a song, a simple melody,
Just a rehashing of what you'll see.
This is a song, it's easy to sing,
A repetitive tune, let your heart take wing.

(Chorus)
This is a song, a familiar refrain,
Singing it over and over again.
This is a song, it's all that I've got,
A simple reminder, forget me not.

(Verse 2)
This is a song, with words so plain,
Just a rehashing, like a gentle rain.
This is a song, a comforting sound,
In each repetition, love is found.

(Chorus)
This is a song, a familiar refrain,
Singing it over and over again.
This is a song, it's all that I've got,
A simple reminder, forget me not.

(Bridge)
Though it may seem like déjà vu,
In this repetition, I'm singing to you.
The beauty's in the simplicity,
This is a song, for you and me.

(Verse 3)
This is a song, it'll never grow old,
With each repetition, let the story be told.
This is a song, a timeless rhyme,
In its repetition, you'll stand the test of time.

(Chorus)
This is a song, a familiar refrain,
Singing it over and over again.
This is a song, it's all that I've got,
A simple reminder, forget me not.

(Outro)
This is a song, it's time to part ways,
But in your heart, I hope it stays.
This is a song, a memory's embrace,
With each rehashing, love finds its place.
